# Sentiment Analysis

This project is a **Sentiment Analysis** web application built using **Streamlit**, powered by a **Logistic Regression** model trained on social media text data.

The application performs sentiment classification on user input, categorizing the text as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**.

### Key Features:
- **Preprocessing**: The input text undergoes cleaning by removing URLs, mentions, and punctuation, ensuring the model receives clean input for better performance.
- **Model**: A **Logistic Regression** model trained on a labeled dataset, utilizing **TF-IDF vectorization** to convert text into numerical features.
- **Web Application**: Built using **Streamlit**, enabling users to easily input sentences and instantly receive sentiment predictions in a user-friendly interface.
- **Neutral Sentiment**: A custom threshold to handle neutral sentiments based on the probability output, ensuring more accurate results.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**
- **Streamlit**
- **Scikit-learn** (Logistic Regression, TF-IDF Vectorizer)
- **Pickle** (for model and vectorizer serialization)

### Setup Instructions:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

### Usage:
- Input your text in the provided box, and the model will predict the sentiment!

### Use Cases:
- Analyzing customer feedback and reviews for sentiment.
- Social media sentiment analysis to understand public opinion.
- General-purpose text sentiment classification for various applications.

### Future Improvements:
- Explore more complex models like **BERT** or **RoBERTa** for improved accuracy.
- Expand the dataset to handle more diverse text sources.
- Add multilingual support for sentiment analysis.

### Enhancements:
- **Model/Feature Improvements**: If you plan to upgrade the model in the future, you could also mention experimenting with hyperparameter tuning or implementing cross-validation techniques.
- **UI/UX**: You could mention how you plan to enhance the user interface for even better experience (like adding multiple input forms or displaying confidence scores).

Other than that, it looks well structured and informative!
